//! `AutoReplyRateLimiter` — per-conversation rolling-window throttle for
//! AUTONOMOUS channel sends (the agent's auto-replies to inbound messages).
//!
//! Two Genesis agents wired to the same channel (e.g. two email bots) can
//! auto-reply to each other indefinitely: A replies to B, B replies to A, and
//! so on forever. Neither existing guard catches it — the self/bot loop guard
//! ([`crate::dispatch::classify`]) only drops the channel's own / other bots'
//! messages, and the wayland#547 `Message-ID` echo guard only recognises a
//! channel's own outbound mail bouncing back. In a two-agent ping-pong every
//! message is genuinely new: not a self-echo, not a duplicate, and (from the
//! receiver's side) not flagged as a bot. So both guards pass and the loop runs.
//!
//! This limiter breaks that ping-pong by capping how many autonomous replies a
//! single conversation may emit within a rolling time window. Once a
//! conversation hits the cap, further autonomous sends are suppressed (and
//! logged by the caller) until enough of the window has elapsed for older sends
//! to age out.
//!
//! Only autonomous auto-replies are gated. Human/operator-initiated sends (the
//! `send_message` tool, cron, direct [`crate::ChannelManager::send_to`]) take a
//! different code path and never reach this limiter.
//!
//! Time is caller-supplied (`now: Instant`, monotonic) so the limiter is fully
//! deterministic under test — it never reads the wall clock. Production callers
//! pass `std::time::Instant::now()`.
