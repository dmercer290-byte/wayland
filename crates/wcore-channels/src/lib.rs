//! `wcore-channels` — runtime abstraction for chat-platform adapters
//! (Slack, Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp, Signal, email, SMS, …).
//!
//! Defines the `Channel` trait + `ChannelEvent` enum + config loader
//! (landed in the v0.7.0 channels foundation). Individual channel impls
//! land as their own crates (`wcore-channel-slack` etc.) in the
//! v0.8 channels release. The `ChannelManager` that drives them lives
//! in `manager.rs`.
//!
//! Channels are message-passing surfaces, not transport primitives —
//! they wrap whatever platform-native API exists (HTTP REST, WS
//! gateway, subprocess, IMAP/SMTP) behind a uniform send + poll
//! interface so the engine + UI don't care which platform a message
//! came from.
